\begin{abstract}
A low arithmetic complexity algorithm is proposed to achieve compression of five-dimensional (5-D) Light Field Videos from multi camera array or camera gantry or lenslet cameras. The proposed system employs the 5-D 8 point approximate Discrete Cosine Transform (ADCT), extension of the four-dimensional (4-D) that has already appeared in the literature. Motivated by the partial separability of the multidimensional spectrum of Light Field Videos, the proposed 5-D ADCT is obtained by cascading 2-D intra-view, 2-D inter-view with 1-D transform along time axis. Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Index Similarity Measurement (SSIM) are provided to confirm the performance of 5-D ADCT based Light Field Video compression.

\section{Introduction}

Total distribution of light is defined as seven-dimensional(7-D) Plenoptic function \(p(x,y,z,\theta,\phi,\lambda,t)\), which models light rays at every possible location in in space \((x,y,z)\) towards every possible direction \((\theta,\phi)\) over any range of wavelengths \(\lambda\) and at any time \(t\). Representing Light Field Video as 7-D function needs huge amount of data. To avoid that following assumptions are made: Removing one dimension in space where Light rays do not change along direction of propagation for Light Field Videos and Replacing Frequency \(\lambda\) with three colour channels where all three colour channels of Light Field Videos are treated separately. From these assumptions Light Field Video is represented as five-dimensional(5-D) function \(l(x,y,\theta,\phi,t)\). To simplify Light Field Video representation, Each frames in Light Field Video can be represented using two plane parameterization where one plane is camera plane \(XY\) and other plane is image plane \(UV\). Thus Light Field Video is represented as \(l(x,y,u,v,t)\). Here \((x,y)\) are spatial dimensions and \((u,v)\) are angular dimensions.

Light Field can acquire generally in three ways: Array of multiple cameras which arrange in linear, circular or even in arbitrary, Camera gantry which moves and capture different view points at different time instants and lens-let cameras which include an array of micro-lenses between the main lens and the image sensor. Light Field imaging has additional post capture processing capabilities notably Image refocusing, Depth filtering, Distance measurement, Changing lighting conditions etc. Thus widely applies in fields such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), sports broadcasting, personal communications, visual surveillance, medical imaging etc. Due to large volume of data captured in Light Field Video, it is difficult to process in real-time, mobile or web-based applications, where limited storage and bandwidth are required to store or transmit. Thus, fast and low-complexity compression techniques are needed to reduce number of bits required to process.

In this work, we propose a 5-D Light Field Video Lossy compression system, which is suitable for real-time compression of 5-D Light Field Videos, using 5-D type-2 Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) which has energy compaction property and widely use in data compression applications. The proposed system uses 8 point approximate DCT (ADCT) which are hardware efficient than exact DCT, leads to reduction in chip area and power consumption in digital VLSI hardware. By using 2-D partial separability, 5-D ADCT is obtained as a cascade of two 2-D ADCTs and one 1-D ADCT. Here first 2-D ADCT refers as intra-view transform where operations are done within Sub Aperture Images of particular frame, second 2-D ADCT refers as inter-view transform where operations are done across Sub Aperture Images of particular frame and 1-D ADCT operations are done across frames. Then obtained 5-D ADCT of a Light Field Video is subsequently treated as a collection of 5-D hyper-cubes of size \((8\times8\times8\times8\times8)\) and 5-D quantization happens using constant \((8\times8\times8\times8\times8)\) matrix on it to obtain compressed Light Field Video in 5-D DCT domain. 


\section{Related Work}
2-D Discrete Cosine Transform (2-D DCT) is widely used transform for image and video compression notably in JPEG, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, H.261, H.263, H.264, which has good energy compaction for images. JPEG 2000 and MPEG 4 Visual standards have used 2-D Discrete Wavelet Transform (2-D DWT) which provides high quality compression at low bit rates than 2-D DCT.  4-D Light Field compression is inspired from 2-D image compression where those techniques mentioned above approached in 2 ways in literature: Dividing 4-D Light Field into 3-D blocks like pseudo video or image stack, then apply 3-D DCT or 3-D DWT on those blocks and Second approach is Applying 4-D DCT directly to 4-D Light Field which refers as Multidimensional Light Field Encoder (MuLE), where Light Field is divided into small size 4-D blocks and 1-D DCT applies to each dimension separately. This approach recently used in the JPEG Pleno Verification Model for lenslet Light Field compression. Same as 4-D DWT is also applied to 4-D blocks of Light Field as cascade of four 1-D DWT. Karhunen Loève Transform (KLT) is another transform for Light Field compression where Vector Quantization (VQ) scheme uses to cluster different Micro Images (MI) into a representative set of vectors which are used to coded with KLT. There is an alternative approach for KLT based compression where Sub Aperture Images (SAI) uses instead of Micro Images (MI). Both approaches give same performance but better than DCT based. Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) is recently proposed transform for Light Field Video compression where graph based representation uses to model color, disparity or other geometry information from Light Field. Apart from these transforms, combinations of these transforms are proposed to compress 4-D Light Field in literature notably combination of 2-D DWT with 2-D DCT, combination of 2-D DWT with KLT etc.

Apart from accuracy, reducing floating point operations which increase circuit complexity and power consumption, is an important aspect for real time compression. To achieve this, approximate transforms are introduced in literature notably 8-point approximate DCT, 16-point approximate DCT. Generally approximate DCT matrices can be written as matrix multiplication of diagonal matrix which contain only irrational numbers and low complexity matrix which contains only powers of two. Bouguezel first introduces low complexity 8 point approximate DCT in 2008 which matrix can do matrix multiplication with \(8\times8\) block in 18 additions and 2 shifts but when do with exact 8 point DCT, 64 multiplications and 56 additions need to do that. In 2011, same team came with another transform called Parametric transform, which arithmetic complexity is based on parameter values where parameter value 0 needs 16 additions, parameter value 1 needs 18 additions and parameter value 2 needs 18 additions and 2 shifts. Same year another team proposed an approximate matrix where low complexity matrix has only 0 and 1 to avoid shift operations but that approximate matrix needs 22 additions to do matrix multiplication. Then that team modified and proposed a new matrix which can do matrix multiplication in 14 additions. Same as this another approximate matrix is proposed in 2014, which also needs 14 additions but it gives better SAI quality than previous one. To the best of my knowledge, algorithms mentioned above are applied only for 2-D images, 3-D videos and 4-D Light Fields not for 5-D Light Field Videos.

\section{5-D ADCT Based LFV Compression}
Input to the proposed 5-D ADCT based Light Field Video Compression system is Light Field Video \(l(n)\), Here \(n \equiv (n_x,n_y,n_u,n_v,n_t) \in \mathbb{N}^5 \) denotes 5-D discrete spatial domain, \((n_x, n_y)\) denotes point in camera plane, \((n_u, n_v)\) denotes point in image plane and \(n_t\) denotes point in time axis. Based on standard two plane parameterization, size of Light Field Video is assumed as \((N_x,N_y,N_u,N_v,N_t)\). This indicates there are \(N_t\) number of frames in Light Field Video and each frame has \(N_x \times N_y\) Sub Aperture Images (SAI) where size of each Sub Aperture Image (SAI) is \(N_u \times N_v\) pixels. Light Field Video is used in YUV format and compression has been done in each channel separately. 

First step divide all SAIs of particular frame into \(8 \times 8\) blocks and apply 2-D DCT on it. Let \(X\) be extracted \(8 \times 8\) block, whose entries are given by \(x[n_1,n_2]\) for \(n_1,n_2 = 1,2,...8\) and \(Y\) is 2-D DCT transformation of \(X\), whose entries are given by:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\label{eq1}
y[k_1,k_2] = a_N[k_1] \cdot a_N[k_2] \cdot \sum_{n_1=0}^{N-1} \sum_{n_2=0}^{N-1} x[n_1,n_2] \cdot \\ 
\cos{\left(\frac{\pi k_1(2n_1+1)}{2N}\right)} \cdot \cos{\left(\frac{\pi k_2(2n_2+1)}{2N}\right)}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where 
\[
    a_N[k_i] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}
\begin{cases}
    1,& k_i = 0\\
    \sqrt{2},& k_i = 1,2,..,N-1
\end{cases}
\]
Here N = 8.
To solve equations efficiently, Equation. \ref{eq1} can be written as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq2}
Y = C_N \cdot X \cdot C_N^T   
\end{equation}
where \(C_N\) entries are given by:
\[C_N[k,n] = a_N[k] \cdot \cos{\left(\frac{\pi k(2n+1)}{2N}\right)}\]
To achieve both null multiplier complexity and reduce adder complexity, instead of ideal DCT matrix \(C_N\), approximate DCT matrix \(\hat{C}_N\) is used, which can be written as \(\hat{C}_N  = D_N \cdot T_N\). Here \(D_N\) is diagonal matrix and \(T_N\) is low complexity matrix. This ADCT operation is repeated for all \(8 \times 8\) blocks in all SAIs of particular frame and \(N_x \times N_y \times N_u/8 \times N_v/8 \times N_t\) no of operations needed to complete intra-view ADCT transformation on entire Light Field Video. This leads to create mixed domain 5-D signal \(L_1(n_x,n_y,k_u,k_v,n_t)\).

Next create \(N_x\times N_y\) view points blocks from \(L_1(n_x,n_y,k_u,k_v,n_t)\) by changing pixel point across SAIs of particular frame, divide that into \(8 \times 8\) blocks and apply 2-D DCT on it. As mentioned earlier, To reduce complexity use Approximate DCT matrix \(\hat{C}_N\).This ADCT operation is repeated for all \(8\times8\) blocks across all SAIs of particular frame and \(N_x/8\times N_y/8\times N_u\times N_v\times N_t\) no of operations needed to complete inter-view ADCT transformation on entire Light Field Video. This leads to create mixed domain 5-D signal \(L_2(k_x,k_y,k_u,k_v,n_t)\).

Next take points along time axis from \(L_2(k_x,k_y,k_u,k_v,n_t)\) for particular view point and pixel point, divide that into dimension of \(8 \times 1\) vectors and apply 1-D DCT on it. Let \textbf{x} be extracted \(8 \times 1\) vector, whose entries are given by \(x[n]\) for \(n = 1,2,...8\) and \textbf{y} is 1-D DCT transformation of \textbf{x}, whose entries are given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq3}
y[k] = a_N[k] \cdot \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] \cdot \cos{\left(\frac{\pi k(2n+1)}{2N}\right)}    
\end{equation}
where 
\[
    a_N[k] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}
\begin{cases}
    1,& k_i = 0\\
    \sqrt{2},& k_i = 1,2,..,N-1
\end{cases}
\]
Here N = 8.
To solve equations efficiently, Equation. \ref{eq3} can be written as:
\begin{equation}
Y = C_N \cdot X    
\end{equation}
\(C_N\) entries are given by:
\[C_N[k,n] = a_N[k] \cdot \cos{\left(\frac{\pi k(2n+1)}{2N}\right)}\]
To reduce complexity, we can use approximate DCT matrix \(\hat{C}_N\) instead of ideal DCT matrix \(C_N\).This ADCT operation is repeated for all \(8 \times 1\) vectors along time axis for particular view point and pixel point and \(N_x \times N_y \times N_u \times N_v \times N_t/8\) no of operations are needed to complete 1-D ADCT transformation on entire Light Field Video. This creates fully transformed 5-D signal \(L(k_x,k_y,k_u,k_v,k_t)\).

Final stage in compression is quantization, which is expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq5}
L_q(k) = round \left( \frac{L(k)}{Q(k)} \right) \cdot Q(k) 
\end{equation}
where \(Q(k)\) is constant value matrix and both division and multiplication are done in element wise. Compare with \(L(k)\) coefficients higher than threshold value are only retained in \(L_q(k)\) and this leads to lossy Light Field Video compression.

\section{Performance Analysis}
To measure performance of Light Field Video compression, three Light Field Videos were used : Car, David, Toy. All three Light Field Videos were made from \(15\times15\) multiple camera array. For our processing \(8\times8\) views were taken and all SAIs are in YUV420 format. Table. \ref{table:DatasetsSpecification} summarizes size, minimum and maximum value of each channel data set.

Compression quality is measured by using Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index for Measuring image quality (SSIM) of each SAI. The PSNR between the original SAI A and the reconstructed SAI A’ is computed as follows:
\begin{equation}
PSNR = 10\log_{10}\left( \frac{2^n - 1}{MSE} \right)
\end{equation}
Where n is no of bits in SAI and MSE between the two M×N SAIs A and A’ is given by:
\[MSE = \left(\frac{1}{M\times N} \right)\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \sum_{j=0}^{N-1}(A(i,j)-A'(i,j))^2\]
The SSIM between the original SAI A and the reconstructed SAI A’ is computed as follows:
\begin{equation}
SSIM = \frac{(2\mu_A\mu_{A'}+C_1)(2\sigma_{AA'}+C_2)}{(\mu_A^2+\mu_{A'}^2+C_1)(\sigma_A^2+\sigma_{A'}^2+C_2)}
\end{equation}
Where \(\mu_A,\mu_{A'},\sigma_A,\sigma_{A'},,\sigma_{AA'}\) are local means, standard deviations, and cross covariance for SAIs A, A'. The PSNR and SSIM for Light Field Video are computed by averaging the PSNRs and SSIMs of SAIs individually. The final \(SSIM_{YCbCr}\) of entire Light Field Video is computed using only the luminance component (Y) and final \(PSNR_{YCbCr}\) of entire Light Field Video is computed by using \(PSNR_Y, PSNR_{Cb}\) and \(PSNR_{Cr}\) as follows:
\begin{equation}
PSNR_{YCbCr} = \frac{6PSNR_Y + PSNR_{Cb} + PSNR_{Cr}}{8}    
\end{equation}

In Fig. \ref{fig:bppvspsnr}(a)-(c), PSNR is plotted against compression rate in bits per pixel for 6 different ADCT matrices and exact DCT. When decreasing compression rate, PSNR is also decreasing and at one point it is converging. All 7 PSNR vs compression rate graphs are nearly same for all 3 data sets. For data set Car and Toy, PSNR converges near to 41dB and compression rate starts at near to 0.6 out of 1. For data set David, PSNR converges near to 45dB and compression rate starts at near to 0.3 out of 1. As mentioned in Table \ref{table:DatasetsSpecification}, data set David has small range values than other data sets. This can be reason for that particular data set getting better PSNR values for small compression rate values. In Fig. \ref{fig:bppvsssim}(a)-(c), SSIM is plotted against compression rate in bits per pixel for 6 different ADCT matrices and exact DCT. All 7 SSIM vs compression rate  graphs are nearly same for all 3 data sets. From these, assumption can be taken as final outputs will not be differed when using different ADCT matrices. Here none of the values are less than 0.9 out of 1. From these, assumption can be taken as compression does not loose information that much. Table \ref{table:qval} explains when changing value in constant quantization matrix how compression rate, PSNR, SSIM and energy retained are changing. For this experiment Y channel of data set David is used. When you are increasing quantization value, at one point retained energy rate starts to decrease but compression rate, PSNR and SSIM converge.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper Light Field Video compression is proposed using 5-D DCT. To reduce arithmetic complexity, 8 point approximate DCT is used instead of exact DCT. Proposed system first change Light Field Video in 5-D frequency domain by doing following sequentially : 2-D intra view compression, 2-D inter view compression and 1-D compression along time axis. Then do quantization on it by dividing Light Field Video into \(8\times8\times8\times8\times8\) size blocks and obtain compressed Light Field Video. Here Light Field Video compression done for all three channels separately. At end of this paper, SSIM and PSNR is calculated between original Light Field Video and reconstructed Light Field Video for different approximate 8 point 2-D DCT algorithms which are already published in literature. Based on our results we could get minimum 43 dB average PSNR and 0.91 average SSIM. These indicate our compression algorithm is efficient and we do not loose that much information while compressing. Future work includes 5-D Light Field Video compression implementation in FPGA device and 5-D Light Field Video reconstruction algorithm development using prediction modelling.
