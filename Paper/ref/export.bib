   abstract = {The increasing demand for highly realistic and immersive visual experiences has led to the emergence of richer 3D visual representation models such as light fields, point clouds and meshes. Light fields may be modelled as a 2D array of 2D views, corresponding to a large amount of data, which demands for highly efficient coding solutions. Although static light fields are inherently 4D structures, the coding solutions in the literature mostly employ traditional 2D coding tools associated with techniques such as depth-based image rendering to generate a residual, again to be coded using available 2D coding tools. To address the market needs, JPEG has launched the so-called JPEG Pleno standard, which Part 2 is dedicated to light field coding. The JPEG Pleno Light Field Coding standard includes two coding modes, one based on the 4D-DCT, so-called 4D-Transform mode, and another based on depth-based synthesis, so-called 4D-Prediction. The 4D-Transform coding mode standardizes for the first time a 4D-native light field coding solution where the full light field redundancy across the four dimensions is comprehensively exploited, somehow extending to 4D the 2D coding framework adopted decades ago by the popular JPEG Baseline standard. In this context, this paper describes and analyzes in detail the conceptual and algorithmic design process which has led to the creation of the JPEG Pleno Light Field Coding standard 4D-Transform coding mode. This has happened through a sequence of steps involving technical innovation design and integration where increasingly sophisticated coding tools have been combined and improved to maximize the final rate distortion (RD) performance.},

@report{Levo1996,
   abstract = {A number of techniques have been proposed for flying through scenes by redisplaying previously rendered or digitized views. Techniques have also been proposed for interpolating between views by warping input images, using depth information or correspondences between multiple images. In this paper, we describe a simple and robust method for generating new views from arbitrary camera positions without depth information or feature matching, simply by combining and resampling the available images. The key to this technique lies in interpreting the input images as 2D slices of a 4D function-the light field. This function completely characterizes the flow of light through unob-structed space in a static scene with fixed illumination. We describe a sampled representation for light fields that allows for both efficient creation and display of inward and outward looking views. We hav e created light fields from large arrays of both rendered and digitized images. The latter are acquired using a video camera mounted on a computer-controlled gantry. Once a light field has been created, new views may be constructed in real time by extracting slices in appropriate directions. Since the success of the method depends on having a high sample rate, we describe a compression system that is able to compress the light fields we have generated by more than a factor of 100:1 with very little loss of fidelity. We also address the issues of antialiasing during creation, and resampling during slice extraction .},

   abstract = {Light Field (LF) imaging is a promising solution for providing more immersive and closer to reality multimedia experiences to end-users with unprecedented creative freedom and flexibility for applications in different areas, such as virtual and augmented reality. Due to the recent technological advances in optics, sensor manufacturing and available transmission bandwidth, as well as the investment of many tech giants in this area, it is expected that soon many LF transmission systems will be available to both consumers and professionals. Recognizing this, novel standardization initiatives have recently emerged in both the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) and the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), triggering the discussion on the deployment of LF coding solutions to efficiently handle the massive amount of data involved in such systems. Since then, the topic of LF content coding has become a booming research area, attracting the attention of many researchers worldwide. In this context, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of the most relevant LF coding solutions proposed in the literature, focusing on angularly dense LFs. Special attention is placed on a thorough description of the different LF coding methods and on the main concepts related to this relevant area. Moreover, comprehensive insights are presented into open research challenges and future research directions for LF coding.},

   abstract = {Video processing systems such as HEVC requiring low energy consumption needed for the multimedia market has lead to extensive development in fast algorithms for the efficient approximation of 2-D DCT transforms. The DCT is employed in a multitude of compression standards due to its remarkable energy compaction properties. Multiplier-free approximate DCT transforms have been proposed that offer superior compression performance at very low circuit complexity. Such approximations can be realized in digital VLSI hardware using additions and subtractions only, leading to significant reductions in chip area and power consumption compared to conventional DCTs and integer transforms. In this paper, we introduce a novel 8-point DCT approximation that requires only 14 addition operations and no multiplications. The proposed transform possesses low computational complexity and is compared to state-of-the-art DCT approximations in terms of both algorithm complexity and peak signal-to-noise ratio. The proposed DCT approximation is a candidate for reconfigurable video standards such as HEVC. The proposed transform and several other DCT approximations are mapped to systolic-array digital architectures and physically realized as digital prototype circuits using FPGA technology and mapped to 45 nm CMOS technology. © 2014 IEEE.},
